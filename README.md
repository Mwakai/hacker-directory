# hacker directory

**🔗 Live site: [talenmud.github.io/hacker-directory](https://talenmud.github.io/hacker-directory)**

A directory of hackers, students, and builders — where every entry is a
pull request. No sign-up form, no database, no admin panel. You fork the
repo, add a folder with your name on it, and your card shows up on the
grid.

Each contributor gets:

- **A card** on the main directory grid — name, role, tags, bio, a link
  to their page.
- **A personal page** (`contributors/your-username/index.html`) that's
  entirely theirs to customise — bio, projects, links, or full-on
  interactive builds like the [live MCMC sampler visualisation](contributors/talen/index.html)
  on Talen's page.

It's less "university project directory" and more "developer social feed
you can hack on."

## How it works

```
contributors/
  talen/
    index.html    ← personal page, fully customisable
    card.json     ← name, bio, github, role, tags, links
  your-username/
    ...
  manifest.json   ← list of contributor usernames
  people.json     ← generated: all card.json files bundled into one array
```

The homepage (`index.html`) fetches `contributors/people.json` — a single
bundled file containing every contributor's card data — and builds the grid
dynamically. No build step runs in the browser, no framework; still just
static files GitHub Pages can serve as-is.

`people.json` itself is generated automatically: a GitHub Action
(`.github/workflows/people-sync.yml`) runs `.github/scripts/build-people.js`
whenever `manifest.json` finishes syncing, reads every contributor's
`card.json`, and commits the combined file back to the repo. Contributors
never edit `people.json` directly — it's always derived from the individual
`card.json` files.

Every PR gets automatically checked (valid `card.json`, correct folder
scope, a quick flagged-content/image scan) by a GitHub Action — see
[`.github/workflows/pr-check.yml`](https://github.com/TalenMud/hacker-directory/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr-check.yml).
Merging itself is manual: a maintainer reviews and merges each PR by
hand rather than auto-merging.
